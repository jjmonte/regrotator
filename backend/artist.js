 * NOTES:
 * 
 * When adding a new artist, be sure to check for duplicate IDs. Cannot have duplicate primary keys, will error.
 * 
 * REMOVING ARTISTS NOT ALLOWED!! If an artist is removed then riyl, songs, and albums break
 * Also, why would you need to delete an artist on here?? If they are pieces of shit, admins can go into the DB
 * and delete them manually.
