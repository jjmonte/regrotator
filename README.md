regrotator

RegRotator is a CRUD app running off a MySQL database that can store data about albums, artists, songs, and DJ playlists. The target audience of this app are those working within the radio industry; specifically college radio.

Albums are the central unit and are categorized H - Hot, M - Mid, L - Light, A - A-pick. This is congruent with the standard format used at WWVU-FM in Morgantown, WV. Other categorical formats are also possible and will be supported in the future.

The tech stack for this app is MERN:

MySQL       - Database
Express.js  - Connects Node.js to Front-end
React.js    - Front-end, GUI
Node.js     - Back-end connection to SQL server
